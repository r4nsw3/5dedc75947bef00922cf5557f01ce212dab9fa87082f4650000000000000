  |   Claim turf anytime, anywhere, with anyone in Splatoon 2, only on      |
  |   Nintendo Switch. Traditional 4-on-4 turf battles return in this       |
  |   full sequel, along with returning modes, new stages, new fashions,    |
  |   new weapons and much more!                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The aim is simple in Turf War: claim as much territory as possible    |
  |   by coating it in your team's colours. The team with the most turf     |
  |   wins! Transform into a squid to swiftly swim through your team's      |
  |   ink. Use these talents to scale walls coated in your colours to       |
  |   reach high-up vantage points, lie in wait for unsuspecting players,   |
  |   or cook up devious strategies.                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   New dual-wielding Splat Dualies join the action, complete with a      |
  |   new Roll move that's great for dodging incoming attacks. Mainstays    |
  |   like the Splat Roller and Splat Charger have also been remixed and    |
  |   all feature brand-new Special weapons.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Work with up to three other players to defeat waves of Salmonid and   |
  |   collect the treasured eggs they leave behind in this brand new        |
  |   mode.                                                                 |

  |   In a first for the series, compete in local multiplayer Turf War      |
  |   battles, whether in TV mode or on-the-go in handheld or tabletop      |
  |   modes. Up to 10 docked Nintendo Switch consoles - eight players and   |
  |   two spectators - can connect via wired LAN, allowing players to       |
  |   create local Private Battle tournaments without the need for an       |
  |   internet connection. Online battles also make a return.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   One half of the famous Squid Sisters, Callie, has gone missing -      |
  |   and Marie has tasked you with finding her! Use different weapons,     |
  |   like the Splat Roller, Slosher, Splatling or the new Splat Dualies,   |
  |   to overcome obstacles, defeat enemies and take down towering bosses   |
  |   on your mission to reunite the Squid Sisters!                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Play on the TV, in handheld mode or in tabletop mode using the        |
  |   Joy-Con or the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (sold separately) and   |
  |   aim your ink using motion controls for accurate aiming!               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Two years have passed in the world of Splatoon, and a lot has         |
  |   changed. Some familiar characters return under different              |
  |   circumstances, and new characters are introduced as well.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Brand new stages like Humpback Pump Track and Musselforge Fitness     |
  |   enter the fray.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Updates will roll out post-launch, adding new stages, fashions and    |
  |   weapons, as the original game did.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   An upcoming smart-phone application for the Nintendo Switch system    |
  |   will enhance matchmaking and allow for voice chat options.            |

  |   It's been a few months since the last Splatoon 2 update, but          |
  |   Nintendo readied a new patch tonight. Version 5.0.1 is out now        |

  |                                                                         |

  |     Inkbrush or Octobrush                                               |

  |   * Fixed an issue in Shellendorf Institute causing players to clip     |
  |     into the stage terrain when moving near a certain wall              |
  |                                                                         |

  |     players to gain access to an Inkrail from an unintended direction   |
  |     by slightly adjusting the rail's position                           |
  |                                                                         |
